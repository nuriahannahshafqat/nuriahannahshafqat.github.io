                        <p>Formula One (F1) is the highest class of international single-seater auto racing. It is sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and has been one of the premier forms of racing since the inaugural season in 1950.</p>
                        <p>F1 cars are the fastest regulated road-course racing cars in the world, thanks to their lightweight construction, aerodynamics, and powerful engines. The F1 World Championship season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, held worldwide on both purpose-built circuits and public roads.</p>

                    <div class="text-content">
                        <p>While F1 is known for its cutting-edge technology and international reach, other motorsport leagues like IndyCar have their own unique characteristics. IndyCar is primarily based in the United States and features both oval and road course racing.</p>
                        <p>Some key differences include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Technology:</strong> F1 cars are generally more advanced with a greater emphasis on aerodynamics and hybrid power units.</li>
                            <li><strong>Circuits:</strong> F1 races on a global scale with circuits across different countries, whereas IndyCar focuses mainly on North American circuits.</li>
                            <li><strong>Competition:</strong> F1 teams often build their own cars, leading to significant differences in performance, while IndyCar teams typically use standard chassis and engines provided by a few manufacturers.</li>
